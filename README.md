# Solid Team

The Solid Team, headed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, provides an organisational umbrella for facilitating a strong open source community in support of Solid. This repository contains work of the Solid Team to meet the needs of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).


## Participation

All substantive contributors must be members of the Solid Team. It’s easy to [join the Solid Team](https://github.com/solid/process) if you’d like to contribute with any role.

The Solid Team has a (member-only) [chat](https://gitter.im/solid/team).

The Solid Team holds meetings at https://meet.jit.si/solid-team on every second Wednesday of the month at 15:00 UTC. Meetings are transcribed and [published](https://github.com/solid/team/tree/main/meetings/). Additional team meetings may be created, in which case Solid Team members will be notified via calendar invitation and in the Solid Team chat.


## Code of Conduct

All work and communication within the Solid Team is covered by the [Solid Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).
