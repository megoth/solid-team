# Manage list of Solid apps

## Responsibilities

The task force is responsible for curating and maintaining a list of Solid applications.

The apps should meet certain criteria that the task force makes publicly available. The task force needs to develop
these criteria (or find old existing ones), ensuring that they're fair and maintainable.

Submissions of new apps should also be made publicly, through mechanics such as Pull Requests to solidproject.org.
