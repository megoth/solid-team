# Practitioners Engagement Task Force

## Responsibilities

Members of the [Practitioners Task Force](https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners) engage with individuals and organizations building Solid software for use in the real world. The Practitioners Task Force should provide networking and collaborating opportunities such as regular online meetups and github repos; provide a pathway between working practitioners and other parts of the Solid community such as the W3C Community Group, SolidProject.org, and Solid World; and support efforts to highlight and publicize the work of practitioners. In keeping with the Solid vision, the Practitioners Task Force should pay special attention to socially beneficial initiatives and strive for diversity of participation. The Practitioners lead should keep the Solid Team informed about practitioner activity.
