# Migrate SolidCommunity.net server from NSS to CSS

## Responsibilities

Currently, [SolidCommunity.net](https://solidcommunity.net/) is running on [NSS](https://github.com/nodeSolidServer/node-solid-server). This work changes the server from NSS to [CSS](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/). We intend this change to have no effect on the users of SolidCommunity.net outside of the aesthetics of the UI. Certain components, such as WAC, will be unchanged.

## Task Members

* Osmar Olivo (Lead)
