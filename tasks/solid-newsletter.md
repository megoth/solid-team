# Solid Newsletter

## Responsibilities

Mebers of the Solid Newsletter Task Force compile information for, write, and send a monthly newsletter. Information for the newsletter may be sourced from anywhere, but a publicly available submission method (like a PR or a public form) must be one source. The Task Force should keep a written record of the rationale for the inclusion or exclusion of submitted information. The Task Force should make an effort to ensure that socially beneficial organizations and underrepresented voices are part of the target audience and highlighted in the content.
