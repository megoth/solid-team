# Solid World

## Responsibilities

Members of the Solid World Organizing Team are tasked with compiling information for organizing and hosting the Solid World webinar. Presenters for the webinar may be sourced from anywhere, but the organizers will provide an open and transparent process for submissions, as well as documenting and informing the Solid Team on the submissions and rationale for selection, as well as other annoucements planned, prior to the event.

The Team should make an effort to ensure that socially beneficial organizations and underrepresented voices are part of the target audience and highlighted in the content.
