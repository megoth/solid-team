# Solid World

## Responsibilities

Members of the Solid World Organizing Team compile information for organizing and hosting the Solid World webinar. Presenters for the webinar may be sourced from anywhere. The organizers will provide an open and transparent process for submissions, and will document and inform the Solid Team of the submissions and the rationale for selection, as well as other planned announcements, prior to the event.

The Team should make an effort to ensure that socially beneficial organizations and under-represented voices are part of the target audience and highlighted in the content.
