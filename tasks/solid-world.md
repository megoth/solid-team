# Solid World

## Responsibilities

Members of the Solid World Team are tasked with compiling information for, organizing, and hosting the Solid World webinar. Presenters for the webinar may be sourced from anywhere, but a publicly available submission method (like a PR or public form) must be one source. The Team should keep a written record of the rationale for the inclusion or exclusion of submitted information. The Team should make an effort to ensure that socially beneficial organizations and underrepresented voices are part of the target audience and highlighted in the content. The team should communicate decisions on the host and presenters to the rest of the Solid team at a Solid Team meeting.
