# Aggregation of Solid-interoperable tools

## Responsibilities

Members should aggregate a list of tools that make use of the Solid specifications in some way.

The tools should meet certain criteria that the task force makes publicly available. The task force needs to develop
these criteria (or find old existing ones), ensuring that they're fair and maintainable.

Submissions of new tools should also be made publicly, through mechanics such as Pull Requests to solidproject.org.
